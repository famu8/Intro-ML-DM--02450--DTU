Consider again the Bicycle rental dataset
in Table 1. We apply backward selection to find an interpretable linear regression model which uses a subset
of the M = 8 attributes to predict the bike rental yr.
Recall backward selection chooses models based on the
test error as determined by cross-validation, and in our
case we use the hold-out method to generate a single
test/training split.
Suppose backward selection ends up selecting the
attributes x1, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, and x8, what is the
minimal number of models which were tested in order
to obtain this result


te pide el numeor de modlos minimos:

como dice que elige todas menos 1 bajas hasta M-1

la formula es 1+M+M-1
